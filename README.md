# Attendance Monitoring System Using Machine Learning

📝 Project Overview:
This project aims to modernize and streamline the traditional attendance-taking process using machine learning and computer vision. By leveraging facial recognition, the system automates attendance logging, enhancing accuracy, security, and convenience in educational and organizational settings.

🛠️ Technology Stack:

🧠 Machine Learning (for facial recognition)

👁️ Computer Vision (image detection & processing)

🎥 Real-time Camera Integration

🗃️ Secure Database for storing records





# How It Works:

1️⃣ A camera captures live facial images of individuals.

2️⃣ The system detects and recognizes faces using a trained ML model.

3️⃣ Upon successful identification, attendance is logged automatically.

4️⃣ Data is securely stored in a central database.

5️⃣ Reports and insights are generated for admins to monitor trends.

# Haar Cascades for Face Detection

1. Feature-Based Detection: Uses rectangular features (edges, lines) for efficient object detection.

2. Boosting Algorithm: Relies on AdaBoost to combine weak classifiers into a strong one.

3. Cascade of Classifiers: Employs a tiered structure to quickly eliminate non-relevant regions and focus on promising ones.

4. Integral Image Concept: Speeds up pixel sum calculation, reducing computation time.

5. Real-Time Detection: Ideal for real-time applications like face detection (e.g., OpenCV).
